<h2 align="center">Employee Management System - Web</h2>

<p align="justify">Employee management system is an web application based system, having two applications developed, one for employers to manage employee details and another for login and registration. Every organization whether government or private uses an information system to store data of their staff. However, in Maharashtra it is found that many colleges use registers to keep a record of their staff. However, there are many advanced technology systems available that can do this work but they all are costly for these low level industries. So we made a system for solving this problems for them at a cheaper cost. This system will help in user registration and login using Sevarth ID of employee and shows details of them. It saves lots of time. So that government can access Details of employees working in different collages.
We call Employee Management System as EMS</p>
